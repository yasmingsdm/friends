# Friends

The goal of this project was to practice the use of Node.js to create a full-stack project.

This project is just to see the name and picture of the main characteres of the TV-series Friends.

### What I've practice /learned:
- create my own hook (React),
- useState (React),
- useEffect (React),
- fetch an API (React),
- props (React),
- http methods (Node).
